    "# Kalman Filter\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the Kalman filter algorithm, which is used for estimating the state of a dynamic system from a series of noisy measurements. By visualizing what the Kalman filter models, we can get a clearer picture of how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that we want to track the position of a bird in the sky. The bird largely moves in a straight line, but it is also a windy day, so the bird is knocked off course a little bit. We can assume that we have a specialized camera that detects the bird's position with a certain amount of noise. The Kalman filter will help us estimate the bird's position over time, even with the noisy measurements.\n",

    "This notebook assumes you have already studied up on the basics of the Kalman filter presented [here](https://ajdillhoff.github.io/notes/tracking/#kalman-filters)"
